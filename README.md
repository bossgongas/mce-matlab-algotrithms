# 📊 MATLAB Root-Finding Algorithms with Animation

This project was developed as part of the course **Métodos Computacionais para a Engenharia Eletrotécnica** at the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Coimbra**.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal was to implement a MATLAB program that animates the application of one of the following root-finding algorithms:

- **Bisection Method**
- **Newton-Raphson Method**
- **Secant Method**

## 🧠 Description

The user starts the program via the `main` function, which launches a menu. The user can:

- Choose which numerical method to use
- Input the required parameters (function, tolerance, interval or starting point)
- See a visual animation of the chosen method step by step

The program includes input validation (e.g., function format, domain, variable check, tolerance range). After each animation, the user returns to the main menu.

## 🧪 Technologies

- MATLAB
- `fzero` for reference root validation
- Custom-built menu and animation functions

## 📄 Files

- `Relatorio_Projeto.pdf` - final report with methodology and explanations
- `src/` - folder with all `.m` files (main, menu, method implementations)
